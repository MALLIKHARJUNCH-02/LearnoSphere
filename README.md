## 🧾 Desktop Reflection Panels (UX Detail)

Text-based insights placed beside the calendar:

- Weekly reflection summaries
- Streak strength explanations
- Consistency observations

**Why text?**
- Calm
- Non-judgmental
- Easy to process on large screens

---

## 🧩 UX Process

### 1️⃣ Research (Lightweight)
- Self-observation as a learner
- Informal discussions with students
- Review of existing EdTech patterns

**Key insight:**  
Motivation fades, but habits survive when UX is calm and predictable.

## 👤 User Persona
### 2️⃣ Persona

### Persona: Charan

**Age:** 23  
**Role:** Self-learner / College graduate preparing for skill growth  

### 🎯 Goals
- Build a **consistent daily study routine**
- Track **levels, milestones, and achievements**
- Feel a clear sense of **progress and growth**, not just effort

### 😣 Pain Points
- Puts in effort but **cannot clearly see improvement**
- Existing learning apps focus only on streaks, not progress depth
- Feels demotivated when achievements are not visible
- Wants recognition for consistency without pressure or guilt

### 🧠 Motivation
- Small wins and visible achievements
- Clear indicators of growth (levels, progress states)
- Calm feedback instead of harsh reminders

### 📱 Behavior & Preferences
- Checks progress at the end of the day
- Prefers **simple, minimal interfaces**
- Responds better to reflection and insights than notifications
- Uses desktop for review and planning, mobile for daily check-ins

### 💡 Design Implications
This persona influenced several UX decisions:
- Inclusion of **achievement and level indicators**
- Text-based reflection panels instead of aggressive alerts
- Clear explanation of streaks to avoid guilt
- Different experiences for mobile (quick checks) and desktop (reflection)
